We're really happy to announce that we can now support DRM encrypted streams
on some services including Plus7.

A new add-on called *DRM Helper* is availabe in our repository that will guide
you through the installation of the libraries to decode the streams encrypted
with Google's Widevine DRM technology.

For services that require DRM decryption, you will be prompted to install the
libraries if required, so there's no more you need to do.

For more information, see our dedicated [DRM]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/drm/) page.
