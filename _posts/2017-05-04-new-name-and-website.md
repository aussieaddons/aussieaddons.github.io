We've been very surprised about how popular our add-ons have become, so we've
decided to become a little more professional, so we're now known as *Aussie
Add-ons*, and we're phasing out the xbmc-catchuptv-au name.

We've also launched a new website at [http://aussieaddons.com](http://aussieaddons.com)
with better documentation.

We've got some really nice error reporting code built in and we're now able
to support DRM encrypted streams on services like Plus7 and 9Now.

We apprecate your feedback via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aussieaddons) or
our Slack channel.

Thanks for your support.
