We're pleased to announce that the
[7plus add-on]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/addons/plus7)
has been tested and is now available in the main Aussie Add-ons repository.

This new add-on replaces the deprecated Plus7 add-on and the shows that had
gone missing from Plus7 are now available in the 7plus add-on.

For those with the Aussie Add-ons repository set up, you should recieve the
update to your add-on automatically. It can take some time for the icon to
change, due to Kodi's caching, but you should notice the new add-on title.

The new 7plus add-on is using MPEG-DASH for delivering h264 encoded video
in high quality, and live streams are supported.

As always, we appreciate your feedback, so feel free to [contact us on Twitter
or join our Slack channel]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).

Thanks and enjoy.
