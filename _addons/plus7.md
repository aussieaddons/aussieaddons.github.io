## Current status

Plus7 is supported, but some programs are not available.

Some programs (generally non-Australian produced content) are not watchable due to Digital Rights Management (DRM) being enforced on them.

There is a way to enable DRM support (using Widevine) in Kodi and we have successfully tested this, but it is complex and not ready for general use.

We are optimistic that Widevine DRM support will be available in Kodi v18 later this year.
