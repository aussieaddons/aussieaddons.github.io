We're happy to announce that initial support for 7plus is available in our
[development]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/development/) repository.

For users with the existing Plus7 add-on installed and with the development
respository set up, your add-on should automatically update from Plus7 to the
new 7plus add-on.

So far, we've found the 7plus service to work quite well, supporting live
and catch-up TV in high quality, even at 1080p.

For any questions or feedback, [get in touch with us]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).
