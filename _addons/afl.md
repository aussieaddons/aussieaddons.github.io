## Current status

AFL Video is fully supported, with the following functionality:

 - Live matches (AFL Live Pass required)
 - Match replays (AFL Live Pass required)
 - On-demand video clips (Coach press-conferences, highlights, Team video, etc)

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
  <h4>Kodi version requirement</h4>
  You will need to use at least Kodi v17 for this to function correctly, due to the HTTPS encryption enforced on the streaming servers.

## Live streaming and match replays 

You can use a valid AFL Live Pass subscription to watch live streaming and match replays through this add-on. This can be either a subscription paid for through AFL.com.au or it can be a Telstra free subscription through a mobile plan.

To sign on, it is recommended you install the AFL app to your Android or iOS device and follow the setup instructions. Once completed, you should enter your account details into the AFL Video add-on settings.

Live streaming is intended for mobile use only, and so the quality is poor, but watchable.


## AFL Live Pass (free) with a Telstra service

For the free Telstra Live Pass, you must have an active mobile subscription, excluding business plans. If you use a pre-paid plan, you need to ensure you never run out of credit, or you will need to re-activate the subscription.

If you are an existing Telstra customer, but don't have a Telstra ID, you can [register for your Telstra ID here](https://id.telstra.com.au/register?red=/register).
