We're working hard to keep up with streaming service changes, but occasionally things don't always work right. There's hope though.


## Testing development builds

Along with our production repository, we also have a development repository where we stage and test major updates to our add-ons.

If you would like to try out development versions of our add-ons, we encourage you to install the development repository.

You can grab the the [development repository ZIP file](http://r.aussieaddons.com/repo-devel.zip) or follow the instuctions on the [installation]({{ site.baseurl }}/installation) but choose the `repo-devel.zip` file instead.


## Filing bug reports

We track bugs, issues and feature requests through each add-on's own GitHub issue tracker. You can find a link for the issue tracker in each [add-ons page]({{ site.baseurl }}/addons). 

GitHub pull requests are greatly appreciated for fixes or enhancements. Please [get in touch]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) if you're interested in contributing.


## Obtaining your log file

Log files are crucial for diagnosing add-on issues, so we appreciate if you could provide one in your bug report.

A nice, easy [guide for uploading your Kodi log file](http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy) is a great place to start.
