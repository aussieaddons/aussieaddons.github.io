We want you to feel comfortable using Aussie Add-ons.

## Issue reports

When an issue occurs in any of our add-ons, you may be prompted to post an automatic issue report.

The issue report provides us with details about the code exception you encounted, and a trace of the code path that led to the exception and a copy of your Kodi log file.

Our add-ons do not log any usernames or passwords (e.g. Telstra Live Pass) but we do filter out any possible usernames or passwords that may be contained in your log file from other add-ons.

An issue report also contains some information about your system. For example, we collect details about:

 * Kodi version
 * Hardware information
 * Operating system type and version
 * Your IP address and possible ISP
 * What program/stream you were trying to access

These details in issue reports greatly assist in helping us to track down issues in our code, butiIf you are concerned about any of these details being sent to us, feel free to choose _No_ when you are prompted to file an issue report.

## Analytics

We will be testing out some analytics in new releases of our add-ons. This will be to help us gain insight into how many people are using our add-ons and how they might be used and on which platforms.

The information gathered may include:

 * Kodi version
 * Hardware information
 * Operating system type and version
 * Your IP address and possible ISP
 * What program/stream you were trying to access

There will be no identifying information sent, but if you are concerned about your privacy, you can disable it in the add-on settings.
