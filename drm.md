Many streaming services are now implementing Digital Right Management (DRM) security to their streams.

On most platforms, we support decoding of these streams using the Inputstream.Adaptive support found in Kodi v17 and later.

We have built a `DRM Helper` add-on which manages the installation of the specific libraries required for decoding Widevine encrypted streams through the Inputstream.Adaptive system.

More details about specific platforms and FAQs to be added to this page shortly.
