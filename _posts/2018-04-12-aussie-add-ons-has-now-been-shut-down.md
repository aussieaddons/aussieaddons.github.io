It's with our greatest displeasure to announce that Aussie Add-ons will no
longer be operating.

After being contacted by some content providers about copyright violations,
we believe it's best that we stop supporting all of our add-ons.

Our aim was to support those users wanting to use free and Open Source
software to enjoy Australian free-to-air content on their Kodi installations,
which I think we managed to do.

Unfortunately it seems we have crossed a line, and therefore we must comply
and remove all of our add-ons and code.

It's been a pleasure working on this project, and thanks to our users who
have all been great.
